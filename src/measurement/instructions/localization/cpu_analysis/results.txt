For the experiment in feature3, this server was located in WEH4107, while the other server was 
located in Christian's office. For the experiment in feature6, both servers where located in 
Christian's office. 

The screen captures for both features show that MOVE_BASE is the process that consumes the CPU the 
most, most of the time. ROBOT_STATE_PUBLISH is another ROS node that consumes CPU and sometimes it 
does so more than AMCL and some other times consumes less than AMCL. GROUND_TRUTH_POSE, 
LOCALIZATION_CPU_MONITOR are nodes used by the infrastructure to collect data and will not be part 
of a regular TurtleBot run when no data is collected. NODELETS, on the other hand, are various 
ROS processes that execute some logic for the TurtleBot to execute and will be present during a 
regular execution, even if data is not collected. 

The values under the CPU column are the % utilization for 1 CPU.
